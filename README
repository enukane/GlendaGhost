GlendaGhost - TwitterClient

-- WTF is this --
always show Glenda on top of your desktop,
works like ukagala( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukagaka )... maybe in future

In addition, on this branch, it works as twitter client.
Currently it does not support posting tweets, only for viewing.

-- dedication --
Thanks for @d_kami for helping & advising me on programming,
and other colleagues in softlab.
